* Internal Style Sheet
- Styling is defined within <head>
- Rules are defined with <style>

- A link to the style sheet is put in the head section
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> 
- Style are applied to all elements with the name we Adding

* Css Model
- Browser default

- Internal Style sheet
- Inline style sheet (inside an HTML element)

    + the rule from the most recent file have predcedentec 
- What if one selector has more than one rule in the same file
    + the code will use the what is saw last
